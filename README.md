Created using create-react-app

Added responsiveness, filtering, create user, delete user and pagination (set to 5 contacts per page)

To save the drag and drop contacts order need to use custom fields -> create custom-field for each contact with his id number in the list and update it whether the ordering has changed. Then render the contacts based on the id.
